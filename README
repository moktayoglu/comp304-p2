All parts working

to compile use:
gcc [project_file_name] -o [executable name] -lpthread

Implementation details:

For synchronization of five types of gift bundles we have made the code add the downstream task after the task is finished. 
Each type of task's thread start of with the first 1 or 2 starting tasks that leads to packaging. With appropriate condition checks using mutexes.
the next downstream task is added to the following queue.

Specifically for type4 and type5 tasks where QA and Paint (or assembly) caan occur simultaneously but both need to be finished to proceed to packaging we 
used counting mutexes.

For part2 and part3 necessarry conditions are added.
